## About

I’m Jess Kovach.

I write, speak, and work as a leadership advisor and consultant focused on leadership, systems, and how people make decisions when the answers aren’t clean and the stakes are real.

I don’t approach this work from the belief that people are broken. Most people are doing the best they can inside systems they don’t fully understand, responding to pressure, incentives, and expectations that are rarely made explicit. Often, what looks like resistance, disengagement, or conflict is confusion—or an unspoken emotional response people don’t have language for and feel embarrassed to name.

My perspective has been shaped inside organizations and institutions where power, accountability, and incentives don’t always line up, and where the human impact of decisions can be easy to underestimate. I’m interested in what leadership actually looks like in those environments: when clarity is partial, pressure is constant, and values are easier to reference than to practice.

Alongside my writing and speaking, I work directly with leaders navigating change, burnout, and moments where personal responsibility and institutional expectations collide. I’m less interested in fixing people than in helping them slow down enough to name what’s happening, understand the forces at play, and move forward with greater clarity and steadiness.

A significant part of my work involves neurodivergent leaders and the teams around them. I pay close attention to how leadership norms shape who is heard, how difference is interpreted, and how certain behaviors are rewarded or misread—often not out of malice, but out of misunderstanding and unexamined habit.

I also work as a human rights consultant, with a focus on anti-trafficking efforts and the protection of children in humanitarian settings. That work has influenced how I think about responsibility, harm, and leadership under pressure—particularly in environments where decisions carry lasting consequences for people who have little power to absorb them.

Everything I do comes back to a central concern: how decisions are made inside complex systems, who bears their costs, and what responsibility looks like when the outcomes are human.

That question runs through my writing.
