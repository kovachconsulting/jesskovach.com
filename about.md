**About**

I’m Jess Kovach.

I write and speak about leadership, power, and decision-making in systems where the stakes are human and the answers are rarely clean. My work is driven by a tension I’ve seen play out repeatedly: decisions are made in the name of efficiency or strategy, while their real consequences—on people, communities, and trust—are treated as secondary.

My perspective has been shaped by years inside organizations and institutions where incentives, accountability, and values don’t always align. I’ve watched how power moves quietly through systems, how responsibility gets diluted, and how the people closest to the impact are often the least heard. I’m interested in what leadership actually requires when clarity is hard-won and certainty is an illusion.

Alongside my writing and speaking, I work as a life coach and neurodivergent coach, supporting people navigating leadership, change, burnout, and identity inside systems that were not designed with them in mind. I’m less interested in fixing people than in helping them name what’s happening, tell the truth about it, and move forward with clarity and agency.

I also work as a human rights consultant, with a focus on anti-trafficking efforts and protecting the rights of children in humanitarian settings. That work has fundamentally shaped how I think about responsibility, harm, and leadership—and why abstract decisions are never abstract when real lives are involved.

At the center of my work is a single question:

How do we lead—and make decisions—responsibly inside complex systems, especially when the cost of getting it wrong is carried by others?
