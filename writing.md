**Writing**

Most of the decisions that shape our lives aren’t made in moments of crisis or clarity.

They’re made quietly—inside systems, policies, incentives, and defaults. They’re made under time pressure, imperfect information, and expectations that rarely show up on an org chart. And by the time their impact is visible, responsibility has often become diffuse.

My writing focuses on those moments.

I write about leadership when certainty is unavailable, about power that operates without announcement, and about accountability in environments where harm is rarely intentional—but often predictable. I’m interested in how systems shape behavior, how people rationalize decisions they’re uncomfortable with, and what it actually means to lead responsibly when tradeoffs are unavoidable.

Some of this work is analytical. Some of it is reflective. All of it is grounded in lived experience—inside organizations, in coaching conversations, and in human rights work where the cost of getting things wrong is not theoretical.

I don’t write to offer easy answers or universal frameworks. I write to make patterns visible: to name what’s happening beneath the surface, to slow down the rush to justification, and to create space for better questions.

If you’ve ever felt the tension between what you’re expected to do and what you know is right—this work is for you.

Writing is where I slow things down enough to see what’s actually happening—where incentives, power, and responsibility can stay visible without being simplified.

But some questions don’t resolve on the page. They surface tension. They ask to be spoken aloud, in rooms where decisions are made and accountability is shared.
