I write about leadership, systems, and what it means to make decisions inside complexity without losing your values — or your humanity.

Some of what I write is analytical, some of it is personal. Most of it lives in the space where lived experience meets structure: where power, accountability, identity, and human impact intersect in real organizations and institutions.

This newsletter is a place to slow things down. I use it to name patterns, question assumptions, and make sense of situations that often get flattened or oversimplified. I’m less interested in hot takes and more interested in clarity — especially when the answers aren’t clean or comfortable.

If you’re navigating leadership, change, burnout, or systems that don’t quite fit, you’re likely to find something here that resonates. I write for people who care about doing meaningful work with integrity, even when the path forward isn’t obvious.
