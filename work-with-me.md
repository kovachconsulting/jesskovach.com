**Work With Me**

Most of my work begins the same way:
someone is navigating complexity that can’t be reduced to a framework, a diagnosis, or a productivity fix.

They’re leading inside systems with competing incentives.
They’re carrying responsibility without full authority.
They’re making decisions where the human impact matters—and the answers aren’t obvious.

That’s where I come in.

I work with individuals and organizations who want to think more clearly, act more responsibly, and stay intact while doing it. This isn’t about optimization or performance for its own sake. It’s about sense-making, discernment, and agency inside real constraints.

My work is grounded in three overlapping areas:

I coach leaders and individuals—often neurodivergent, often burned out, often questioning—to help them name what’s actually happening, clarify what’s within their control, and move forward without self-betrayal.

I consult with organizations navigating change, accountability gaps, or leadership tension, helping surface the dynamics that are shaping decisions beneath the surface.

And I advise on human rights–related work, particularly where power, harm, and responsibility intersect in complex systems.

Across all of it, my role is the same:
to slow the moment down just enough for clarity to emerge.

I don’t offer scripts. I don’t fix people. And I don’t pretend complexity disappears if you choose the “right” mindset. Instead, I help clients develop better questions, stronger judgment, and a more honest relationship with the systems they’re operating within.

If my writing sharpens how you think, and my speaking resonates with how you see the world, working together is where those ideas become practical.

Most people reach out before they’re certain what they need. They just know the situation they’re in can’t be approached casually—or alone.

If that’s where you are, my contact information is below.
