**Work With Me**

I work with people and organizations who are making real decisions inside complex systems—where the stakes are human, the constraints are real, and clarity matters more than consensus.

Most of the people I work with are already capable, thoughtful, and experienced. What they’re navigating isn’t a lack of intelligence or effort. It’s the weight of responsibility inside systems that don’t always reward integrity, transparency, or care. The work begins when the usual playbooks stop working.

My role is not to provide answers, motivation, or optimization frameworks. It’s to help leaders and decision-makers see what they’re inside of—how power, incentives, and structure are shaping their choices—and to move forward with clarity when the path isn’t obvious and the costs are real.

This work often sits at the intersection of leadership, identity, and accountability. It can involve navigating change, burnout, moral injury, or moments when personal values and institutional expectations collide. For neurodivergent leaders in particular, it can mean untangling what belongs to the system from what has been wrongly internalized as personal failure.

I also work in contexts where the consequences of decisions extend well beyond the room. My background in human rights and humanitarian work has shaped how I think about harm, responsibility, and leadership under pressure. It has made me deeply attentive to who bears the cost of decisions—and who is protected from them.

The work we do together is often quiet. It’s reflective, rigorous, and grounded in reality. It’s less about fixing and more about naming. Less about speed and more about alignment. Progress tends to look like steadier judgment, clearer boundaries, and decisions that hold up over time.

I don’t work with everyone, and this isn’t fast or performative work. It’s most effective when there is space for honesty, complexity, and discomfort without collapse.

If this kind of work is relevant, you’ll know when the moment arrives.
