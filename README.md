# Jess Kovach

I have spent more than two decades leading inside consumer technology — first in the wireless industry as it took shape in the early 2000s, and later at one of the world’s leading technology retailers — watching how technology moved from promise to infrastructure, and how its impact on people became shaped less by innovation than by incentives, power, and control.

My work now focuses on making those systems legible: how corporations, operating systems, and governments increasingly reinforce one another in ways that prioritize profit, scale, and compliance over human well-being.

## What This Is

This repository is a public hub for my writing, analysis, and project work, grounded in lived experience inside large consumer technology organizations.

It reflects a long view of how the technology industry formed, expanded, and normalized itself — and how decisions made far from the sales floor, support queue, or policy table quietly shape people’s lives, choices, and rights.

This work exists now because the systems that shape daily life — technology, corporations, and government — have become deeply intertwined, while accountability for their consequences has grown increasingly diffuse.

## Writing, Advocacy & Analysis

I write about technology, institutions, power, gender, and democracy in plain language, drawing on years of leadership in retail technology and firsthand exposure to how corporate strategy becomes lived reality.

Working through the rise of wireless, and later inside a global technology retailer, shaped how I understand technology’s role in society. I saw how operating systems become gatekeepers, how corporate incentives align with regulatory and governmental interests, and how “user experience” often masks extraction, surveillance, and dependency.

My writing focuses on how these systems fail people slowly and predictably — not through dramatic collapse, but through normalized tradeoffs that privilege growth, compliance, and profit over care.

In addition to public writing, I have submitted written work and analysis to the United Nations, focused on governance failures, accountability mechanisms, and the human cost of institutional neglect.

## Building (Informed by the Front Lines of Technology)

I build selectively, informed by years of leading teams where technology met people in real time — on sales floors, in support conversations, and in moments of friction that rarely make it into strategy decks.

My current project, [CoachCRM / Base44](https://app.jesskovach.com), reflects that experience. It is designed to support follow-through, transparency, and human-centered accountability, rather than scale for its own sake.

The emphasis is on usability, incentives, and ethical design — building systems that acknowledge how people actually work, not how organizations wish they did.

## Systems I Focus On

My work centers on consumer technology as infrastructure, corporate power inside ostensibly neutral platforms, and the quiet alignment between technology companies and government interests.

I am particularly interested in how accountability erodes once systems grow large enough to feel inevitable, and how harm becomes normalized through convenience, dependency, and institutional silence.

---

## Current Focus

I am currently focused on long-form public-interest writing, institutional accountability, and connecting technology, governance, and law to lived human outcomes rather than abstractions.
