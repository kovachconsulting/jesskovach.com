title: Work With Me
---

I work with individuals and organizations who are navigating complexity — and who want to engage with it thoughtfully, not bypass it.

Depending on what you’re looking for, there are a few different ways we might work together.

---

### Coaching
I offer life coaching and neurodivergent coaching for people navigating leadership, change, burnout, identity, and decision-making in systems that weren’t designed with them in mind.

My approach is practical, reflective, and values-driven. I’m less interested in fixing people and more interested in helping them make sense of what’s happening, clarify what matters, and move forward with agency.

If coaching feels like the right starting point, email me with a brief note about what you’re navigating.

### Speaking & Facilitation
I speak and facilitate conversations for organizations, teams, and communities who want honest engagement around leadership, systems, and human impact.

This work includes keynotes, workshops, moderated conversations, and smaller interactive sessions. You can learn more about my speaking work on the Speaking page, or reach out directly with details about your event.

### Consulting & Human Rights Work
I also work as a consultant on projects related to leadership, organizational systems, human rights, anti-trafficking efforts, and the protection of children’s rights in humanitarian contexts.

If you’re exploring a collaboration or consulting engagement, please share a bit of context about the work and what you’re hoping to accomplish.

### Getting in touch
The best place to start any of these conversations is email.

If you’re not sure which category your inquiry fits into, that’s okay. We can figure that out together.
