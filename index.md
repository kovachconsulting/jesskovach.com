## Jess Kovach

I write and speak about how technology, corporations, and institutions shape people’s lives — often quietly, and rarely by accident.

After more than two decades leading inside consumer technology, my work focuses on making systems legible: how incentives, power, and control get normalized, and how responsibility for their consequences is pushed onto individuals instead of structures.
