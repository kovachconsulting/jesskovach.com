**Speaking**

Some ideas don’t belong only on the page.

They need to be spoken—carefully, precisely, and in rooms where decisions are actually being made.

My speaking work grows directly out of my writing. I’m invited into conversations where leaders, teams, and institutions are grappling with complexity they can’t simplify away: competing values, diffuse accountability, systems that reward the wrong behaviors, and decisions whose consequences are deeply human.

I speak about leadership when certainty is unavailable. About power that operates quietly. About responsibility when outcomes are shared, delayed, or inconvenient to name. And about what it looks like to slow down long enough to make better decisions—without pretending the stakes aren’t real.

These talks are shaped by experience across organizational leadership, coaching, and human rights work, where theory meets consequence and clarity matters. I’m often brought in not to motivate, but to help people see what they’re already navigating—and to give language to tensions they’ve felt but haven’t been able to articulate.

Audiences don’t leave with slogans or scripts. They leave with sharper questions, clearer awareness, and a stronger sense of agency inside the systems they’re part of.

If my writing resonates, speaking is where those ideas meet real-time dialogue—where complexity is named out loud, and responsibility becomes something we can actually work with.

If you’re looking for a speaker who treats your audience as thoughtful, capable adults—and who understands what it means to lead when the answers aren’t clean—we should talk.

When clarity has to hold under pressure—when the room matters as much as the idea—that’s where my work tends to move next.
