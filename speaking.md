title: Context & Speaking
---

My work is rooted in a simple reality: leadership and decision-making are rarely clean, and the systems we operate in often shape outcomes more than individual intent.

I write regularly in a more personal, reflective voice elsewhere. This site — and my speaking work — is where that reflection meets a more structured lens. I focus on sense-making: helping people understand the systems they’re operating in, the pressures shaping their choices, and the values they want to hold onto when things get complicated.

My experience spans corporate, nonprofit, and humanitarian contexts. Across those spaces, I’ve seen how ambiguity is unavoidable, tradeoffs are real, and clarity is often in short supply. I’ve also seen how accountability, care, and honest conversations can fundamentally change outcomes — for individuals, teams, and communities.

My human rights work, particularly around anti-trafficking efforts and the protection of children’s rights in humanitarian settings, has sharpened how I think about harm, responsibility, and leadership under pressure. It has reinforced the importance of systems that protect people — especially when they are most vulnerable.

As a speaker, I work best with audiences who are tired of platitudes and ready for conversations that reflect reality. My talks are grounded, candid, and designed to help people name what they’re already experiencing — then move forward with greater clarity and intention.

Common themes include:
- Leading and deciding in ambiguity  
- Neurodivergence, leadership, and work designed for real humans  
- Values-driven leadership under pressure  
- Power, accountability, and responsibility in complex systems  
- Human rights, harm prevention, and ethical leadership  

If this work resonates, I’m glad you’re here.
