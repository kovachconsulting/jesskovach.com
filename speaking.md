Most conversations about technology move too fast.

They rush to solutions before anyone has agreed on the problem, or they flatten complex systems into slogans that feel reassuring but change very little.

My talks create space to slow that down.

I speak to audiences who already sense that something isn’t working — in their tools, their incentives, or the decisions they’re being asked to make — but haven’t had the time or language to examine it clearly.

Rather than presenting answers, I help groups see what they’re already inside.

How power moves through platforms.
How defaults quietly shape behavior.
How “efficiency” often displaces accountability.

These talks are not designed to motivate or instruct. They are designed to clarify.

In the room, that usually looks like people recognizing patterns they’ve lived with for years but never fully named. Tension becomes easier to hold. Conversations get more honest. Decisions get quieter — and better.

I speak at conferences, internal leadership gatherings, and private sessions where the stakes are real and the audience is expected to think, not perform.

If my writing resonates with you, speaking is where that recognition becomes shared — where individuals realize they aren’t alone in what they’re noticing, and organizations begin to ask more careful questions about what they’re building and why.
