#Speaking

Writing names the problem. Speaking changes what people do with it.

When these ideas move into a room, something shifts. What was abstract becomes relational. What felt isolating becomes shared. People start recognizing patterns they’ve been navigating alone—and realizing they’re not personal failures, but structural ones.

I speak to make systems legible in real time.

My talks are grounded in lived experience inside large consumer technology organizations, paired with a clear-eyed analysis of how power, incentives, and compliance actually function. I’m not interested in performance or provocation for its own sake. I’m interested in what happens when people finally have language for what they’ve been feeling—and the space to think differently about their role inside it.

Audiences often come in expecting a talk about leadership, technology, or organizational change. What they leave with is something more precise: a clearer understanding of how decisions are shaped, where responsibility goes to hide, and what integrity looks like when the system doesn’t reward it.

I don’t position myself as an expert standing above the room. I speak as someone who has lived inside these dynamics, made compromises, felt the tension, and learned where the real leverage points are—often uncomfortably close to home.

These conversations tend to stay with people because they don’t offer easy prescriptions. They offer orientation.

Afterward, the questions usually sound like this:

How do I lead without becoming what I’m critiquing?
What responsibility do I actually have—and what’s been quietly offloaded onto me?
What does ethical action look like when the rules are designed to diffuse it?

Speaking creates a shared frame for those questions—one that teams, leaders, and institutions can return to when the pressure is on.

For some audiences, that’s enough. For others, it becomes the beginning of deeper work.

That’s where collaboration comes in.
