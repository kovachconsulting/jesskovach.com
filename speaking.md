**Speaking**
Some ideas don’t belong only on the page.

They need to be spoken—carefully, precisely, and in rooms where decisions are actually being made.

My speaking work grows directly out of my writing and leadership experience. I’m invited into conversations where leaders, teams, and institutions are grappling with complexity they can’t simplify away: competing values, diffuse accountability, systems that reward the wrong behaviors, and decisions whose consequences are deeply human.

I speak about leadership when certainty is unavailable. About power that operates quietly. About responsibility when outcomes are shared, delayed, or inconvenient to name. And about what it looks like to slow down long enough to make better decisions—without pretending the stakes aren’t real.

Over more than two decades in senior leadership roles, I’ve watched the same failures repeat across organizations: difference mistaken for dysfunction, foresight dismissed as negativity, and clarity sacrificed in the name of speed. Under pressure, leaders often respond to perceived tone instead of substance—and organizations lose insight, trust, and talent as a result.

My work helps leaders pause interpretation, ask better questions, and translate complexity into action. I focus especially on how leadership systems succeed or fail when different cognitive styles are in the room—particularly for neurodivergent leaders and the teams who work with them.

I’m often brought in not to motivate, but to help people see what they’re already navigating—and to give language to tensions they’ve felt but haven’t been able to articulate.

Audiences don’t leave with slogans or scripts. They leave with sharper questions, clearer awareness, and a stronger sense of agency inside the systems they’re part of.

If you’re looking for a speaker who treats your audience as thoughtful, capable adults—and who understands what it means to lead when the answers aren’t clean—we should talk.

When clarity has to hold under pressure—when the room matters as much as the idea—that’s where my work tends to move next.

**Signature Speaking Topics**
My speaking engagements are built around a small number of signature sessions that can be delivered as keynotes, workshops, or facilitated conversations, depending on context.

**Leadership That Works for Different Minds**
How leaders misread difference as resistance—and what it takes to lead effectively across cognitive diversity under pressure.

**Beyond Accommodation: Designing Systems That Don’t Burn People Out**
Moving from individual “fixes” to organizational design choices that reduce friction, fatigue, and attrition.

**Sense-Making Under Pressure**
How leaders interpret complexity, navigate ambiguity, and make better decisions when stability is the exception.

(Each session is adapted for keynotes, workshops, and leadership offsites.)
